I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty [ugly]
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a [blonde] scientist

That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the [car]?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me [hot] in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I never knew a guy who carried a [gun] in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
’Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're [brad pitt]

That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uuh)
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Yeah
